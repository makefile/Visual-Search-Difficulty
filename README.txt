 The scores associated to images from the Pascal VOC 2012 train and validation set
 are provided in CSV and Matlab formats. 

 In VSD_dataset.csv is structured at follows:
 - the first column contains the names of the image files in Pascal VOC 2012;
 - the second column contains the associated difficulty scores.

 The VSD_dataset.mat contains two Matlab variables:
 - names => contains the names of the image files in Pascal VOC 2012;
 - scores => contains the associated difficulty scores (e.g.: names(i) has the
